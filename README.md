# Coffee Shop Order Formatter

## Objective:
In this activity, you'll practice **whiteboarding**, **pseudocoding**, and **writing JavaScript code** to solve a real-world problem. The task is to format customer orders in a coffee shop by trimming extra spaces and displaying the formatted result.

### Problem Overview:
You work at a coffee shop, and your manager has asked you to **format customer orders correctly** before printing them on receipts. Customers might enter their names and drink orders with extra spaces or incorrect formatting. Your goal is to clean up the input and display a formatted confirmation.

### Instructions:
1. **Whiteboard the Problem**:  
   Before jumping into the code, start by **breaking down the problem**. Draw the main steps of the process and how the input will be transformed into the output.

2. **Write Pseudocode**:  
   Write **pseudocode** for the solution. This will be your blueprint before you start coding, helping you focus on the logic without worrying about syntax.

3. **Code the Solution**:  
   After drafting the solution, write the JavaScript code in the script.js file to implement the logic. The tools required for this activity are:
   - **Functions**
   - **Prompt**
   - **Alert**
   - **Document.write**
   - **String Methods** (like `.trim()`)
   - **Template Literals** or **String Concatenation**

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input**: Prompt the user for their name and drink order.
2. **Process**: Trim any extra spaces from both the name and the drink.
3. **Output**: Display the formatted name and drink order using `alert` and `document.write`.

## How to Run:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or open it in your GitHub editor.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The JavaScript code will prompt you for a customerâ€™s name and drink order. Follow the instructions to format the order and display it.

### Example Input & Output:

**Input:**
- Customer Name: `"   aLice    "`
- Drink: `"  LATTE    "`

**Output:**
- `alert`: `Order confirmed: aLice - LATTE`
- `document.write`: `Thank you, aLice! Your LATTE is being prepared.`
